The Foundation for Best Practices in Machine Learning helps data scientists, governance experts, and managers implement ethical and responsible machine learning through open-source organizational and technical best practices.

We are a team of data scientists, machine learning engineers, AI ethicists and governance experts, who are enthusiastic about lowering the barriers for pragmatic ethical and responsible machine learning.


Our Best Practices are designed to be easily accessible to Machine Learning practitioners from a wide variety of backgrounds. Our Best Practices can be adapted to different organisation sizes, needs, risks, resources, and expected societal impact and so the implementation can be flexible.
