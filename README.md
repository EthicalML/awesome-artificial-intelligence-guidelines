## Ethics Guildelines

* [Association for Computer Machinery's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) - This is the code of ethics that has been put together in 1992 by the Association for Computer Machinery and updated in 2018. The Code is designed to inspire and guide the ethical conduct of all computing professionals, including current and aspiring practitioners, instructors, students, influencers, and anyone who uses computing technology in an impactful way. Additionally, the Code serves as a basis for remediation when violations occur. The Code includes principles formulated as statements of responsibility, based on the understanding that the public good is always the primary consideration.
* [European Commission's Guidelines for Trustworthy AI](https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/ai-alliance-consultation) - The Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a document prepared by the High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG). This independent expert group was set up by the European Commission in June 2018, as part of the AI strategy announced earlier that year.
