# Main Content

## High Level Frameworks & Principles

* [AI & Machine Learning 8 principles for Responsible ML](https://ethical.institute/principles.html) - The Institute for Ethical AI & Machine Learning has put together 8 principles for responsible machine learning that are to be adopted by individuals and delivery teams designing, building and operating machine learning systems.
* [Association for Computer Machinery's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) - This is the code of ethics that has been put together in 1992 by the Association for Computer Machinery and updated in 2018. The Code is designed to inspire and guide the ethical conduct of all computing professionals, including current and aspiring practitioners, instructors, students, influencers, and anyone who uses computing technology in an impactful way. Additionally, the Code serves as a basis for remediation when violations occur. The Code includes principles formulated as statements of responsibility, based on the understanding that the public good is always the primary consideration.
* [European Commission's Guidelines for Trustworthy AI](https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/ai-alliance-consultation) - The Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a document prepared by the High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG). This independent expert group was set up by the European Commission in June 2018, as part of the AI strategy announced earlier that year.
* [PWC's Responsibel AI](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/data-and-analytics/artificial-intelligence/what-is-responsible-ai.html) - PWC has put together a survey and a set of principles that abstract some of the key areas they've identified for responsible AI.
* [Singapore Data Protection Govt Commission's AI Governance Principles](https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/Resources/Model-AI-Gov) - The singapore government's Personal Data Protection Commission has put together a set of guiding principles towards data protection and human involvement in automated systems, and comes with a report that breaks down the [guiding principles and motivations](https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Resource-for-Organisation/AI/Model-AI-Framework---First-Edition.pdf).
* [UK Government's Data Ethics Framework Principles](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-ethics-framework/data-ethics-framework) - A resource put together by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) which outlines an overview of data ethics, together with a 7-principle framework for data ethics.

## Processes & Checklists

* [AI RFX Procurement Framework](https://ethical.institute/rfx.html) - A procurement framework for evaluating the maturity of machine learning systems put together by cross functional teams of academics, industry practitioners and technical individuals at The Institute for Ethical AI & Machine Learning to empower industry practitioners looking to procure machine learning suppliers.
* [Ethical OS Tooklkit](https://ethicalos.org/) - A tooklit that dives into 8 risk zones to assess the potential challenges that a technology team may face when, together with 14 scenarios to provide examples, and 7 future-proofing strategies to help take ethical action.
* [Ethics Canvas](https://www.ethicscanvas.org/index.html) - A resource inspired by the traditional business canvas, which provides an interactive way to brainstorm potential risks, opportunities and solutions to ethical challenges that may be faced in a project using post-it note-like approach.
* [Kat Zhou's Design Ethically Resources](https://www.designethically.com/toolkit) - A set of workshops that can be organised across teams to identify challenges, assess current risks and take action on potentiall issues around ethical challenges that may be faced.
* [Markula Center's Ethical Toolkit for Engineering/Design Practice](https://www.scu.edu/ethics-in-technology-practice/ethical-toolkit/) - A practical and comprehensible tooklikt with seven components to aid practitioners reflect, and judge the moral grounds in which they are operating.
* [San Francisco City's Ethics & Algorithms Toolkit](https://ethicstoolkit.ai/) - A risk management framework for government leaderes and staff who work with algorithms, providing a two part assessment process including an algorithmic assessment process, and a process to address the risks.
* [UK Government's Data Ethics Workbook](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-ethics-workbook/data-ethics-workbook) - A resource put together by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) which provides a set of questions that can be asked by practitioners in the public sector, which address each of the principles in their [Data Ethics Framework Principles](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-ethics-framework/data-ethics-framework).
* [World Economic Forum's Guidelines for Procurement](https://www.weforum.org/press/2019/09/uk-government-first-to-pilot-ai-procurement-guidelines-co-designed-with-world-economic-forum/) - The WEF has put together a set of guidelines for governments to be able to safely and reliably procure machine learning related systems, which has been trialed with the UK government.

## Interactive and practical Tools 

* [Aequitas' Bias & Fairness Audit Toolkit](http://aequitas.dssg.io/) - The Bias Report is powered by Aequitas, an open-source bias audit toolkit for machine learning developers, analysts, and policymakers to audit machine learning models for discrimination and bias, and make informed and equitable decisions around developing and deploying predictive risk-assessment tools. 
* [eXplainability Toolbox](https://ethical.institute/xai.html) - The Institute for Ethical AI & Machine Learning proposal for an extended version of the traditional data science process which focuses on algorithmic bias and explainability, to ensure a baseline of risks around undesired biases can be mitigated.
* [IBM's AI Explainability 360 Open Source Toolkt](http://aix360.mybluemix.net/) - This is IBM's toolkit that includes large number of examples, research papers and demos implementing several algorithms that provide insights on fairness in machine learning systems.
