## Overview

As AI systems become more prevalent in society, we face bigger and tougher societal challenges. Given many of these challenges have not been faced before, practitioners will face scenarios that will require dealing with hard ethical and societal questions.

There has been a large amount of content published which attempts to address these issues through “Principles”, “Ethics Frameworks”, “Checklists” and beyond. However navigating the broad number of resources is not easy. 

This repository aims to simplify this by mapping the ecosystem of guidelines, principles, codes of ethics, standards and regulation being put in place around artificial intelligence.
